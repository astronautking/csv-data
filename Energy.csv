272,,Definitions & Technical notes:,,,,
273,,The data on energy supply and renewable electricity production were compiled by the UNSD Energy Statistics Section for the Energy Statistics Yearbook. For more detailed information on these and other energy supply and production indicators please refer to the publication.,,,,
274,,Energy supply is defined as energy production plus imports minus exports minus international marine bunkers minus international aviation bunkers minus stock changes. ,,,,
275,,"Electricity production refers to gross production, which is the sum of the electrical energy production by all the generating units/installations concerned (including pumped storage) measured at the output terminals of the main generators.",,,,
276,,"Renewable electricity production (%) refers to the proportion of total electricity produced that comes from a renewable origin. Electricity production refers to gross electricity production, which is the sum of the electrical energy production by all the generating units/installations concerned (including pumped storage) measured at the output terminals of the main generators. This includes the consumption by station auxiliaries and any losses in the transformers that are considered integral parts of the station. Renewable electricity production was calculated as the sum of electricity produced from hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, tide, wave and ocean sources. All electricity production from combustible fuels is considered non-renewable; therefore electricity produced from burning biomass or renewable waste is not included as renewable electricity in this table. However, this has been observed to be a relatively negligible proportion of electricity production in most cases.",,,,
277,,… denotes no data available.,,,,
278,,,,,,
279,,Data Quality: ,,,,
280,,"The data are compiled primarily from the annual energy questionnaire distributed by the United Nations Statistics Division and supplemented by official national statistical publications, as well as publications from international and regional organizations. Where official data are not available or are inconsistent, estimates are made by the Statistics Division based on governmental, professional or commercial materials. Estimates include, but are not limited to, extrapolated data based on partial year information, use of annual trends, trade data based on partner country reports, breakdowns of aggregated data and analysis of current energy events.",,,,
